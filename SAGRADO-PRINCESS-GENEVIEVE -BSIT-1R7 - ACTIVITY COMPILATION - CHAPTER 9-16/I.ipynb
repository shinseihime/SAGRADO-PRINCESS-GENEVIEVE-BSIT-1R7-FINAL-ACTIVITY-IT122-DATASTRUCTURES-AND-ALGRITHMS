      "     In Chapter 9 it discusses the Graph Data Structure and Algorithms. I have learned from the video that graphs are similar to trees. I have learned that graph consist of finite set of nodes and set of edges which connect a pair of nodes. An example of graphs as presented in the video is Facebook, where graph is being used to represent networks. Facebook platform represent each person with a node, and each node is a structure and contains a person’s information like id, name, gender, sports, and events. I have learned that if a certain node is not in path then we need to make sure that this particular destination has been visited or not, if so then it will be visible in the path. Creating a variable is something we need to create in order to make a path. I have also learned from the video that Graph Data Structure in Facebook is an undirected graph because there is no direction between two nodes. The individual entities are called nodes and the thing that connects those entities are called edges. The element of Facebook’s friend suggestion is an example of utility of graph data structure. Apart from Facebook, flight routes are also an example of utility of graph.\n",

      "     In Chapter 10 it discusses the Binary Search in Python. I have learned and experienced myself that the most common problems that we often solve is the algorithm searching and sorting. In terms of searching I have learned that Binary search is the popular search algorithm. I have also learned the linear search where you iterate all over the data list and when you find the ID it will return to the index. However, Binary Search is not efficient because it checks every code, and if given a larger amount then it would take more time to identify the searches. For example, Students in USTEP. Assuming that the number of students enrolled in USTEP is 50, 000 or more, and you were to search a student’s identification using binary search it would take time to process. I have also learned that lists are sorted, and binary search works well in the concept of list. This is much efficient since you don’t need to iterate unnecessary data. By doing the comparison you are able to rule out the possibilities and determine the right element. So if a student has a last name Roxas, then you ruled out the other students whose last name does not start with R.\n",

      "In Chapter 11 it discusses the Bubble Sort in Python. The have learned the importance of sorting and the reason why we sort data. It is because when sorting a data, it would be easier for you when handling bigger projects, an example is the one I have mentioned on the previous chapter. Sorting would be time wise when searching a data, and bubble sort is one of the sorting techniques. As demonstrated in the video, it says that bubble sort works like this; When you have a list of numbers, it will compare the first two numbers like 70 and 7, 70 is larger than 7 then it will swap and now 7 is in front of 70. This also applies to elements. This process continues until 70 is the highest number and it is placed at the end, hence why it is called bubble shot. When a bubble drops down on the water it will pop and the bottom, it will come from the bottom to top which is same with 70 which was the highest element to pop or appear. So, if you search for 70, its position would be at the end. It compares the element and swaps it not in order.\n",

When used properly, it can be somewhat faster and efficient. I have learned that when performing a quick sort, it is a divide and concur scenario in algorithm. I have also learned that quick sort is a comparison sort, meaning it can sort any time types for which a less-than relation. Is introduced. Quick sort is another sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into similar arrays. I have also learned that a Pivot is a large array that is partitioned into two arrays where one has greater value and the other is smaller. For example: In the list of; \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10  34  9  40  19 ---> 9  10 19  34 40\n",

      "your pivot is 19, where an array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element. While doing so, the pivot element should be positioned where elements less than the pivot ( 9  10 ) is kept at  the left side and elements greater than the pivot ( 34 40 ). The left and right subarrays are likewise divided using the same method and continues in doing so until each subarray contains only one element.\n",

      "In Chapter 13 it discusses the Insertion Sort in Python. I have learned that Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm with very few lines of codes that is best for small lists. If the array is very big, then unfortunately insertion sort is not the best options for sorting because it performs in O(n*2) time complexity. Insertion sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that works similarly to how you sort cards in your hands. The array is divided into two parts, one sorted and the other unsorted. The values from the unsorted part are selected and placed in the sorted part in the proper order. I have also learned that Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that, in each iteration, places an unsorted element in its proper location. Insertion sort works in a similar way to how we sort cards in a card game. We select an unsorted card because we assume the first card is already sorted. If the unsorted card is larger than the one in hand, it goes to the right; otherwise, it goes to the left. I have also learned that Insertion sort is very similar to selection sort. The first k elements in the array are sorted after k passes through it.\n",

      "In Chapter 14 it discusses the Merge Sort in Python. I have learned that Merge sort is another sorting algorithm that gives time complexity of O(nlogn) and thus performs better than insertion sort, bubble sort, and many other sorting algorithms. I have also learned that Merge sort is much similar to Quick sort, which is a divide and conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. I have learned that the function gf merging two halves is merge(). Merge sort function repeatedly divides the array into two halves until we reach a stage where we try to perform merge sort on a subarray of size 1. After that, the merge function comes into play and combines the sorted arrays into larger arrays until the whole array is merged. Merge sorts works by dividing problems into multiple sub-problems. Each sub-problem is solved individually, and finally, sub-problems are combined to form the final solution. I have also learned some drawbacks in merge sorts. Merge sort is slower compare to the other sort algorithms for smaller tasks. Merge sort algorithm requires additional memory space of 0(n) for the temporary array. And lastly, it goes through the whole process even is the array is sorted.\n",

      "In Chapter 15 it discusses the Shell sort in Python. I have learned that shell sort a type of insertion sort that has been customized. If heavy elements are near the end of an array, insertion sort necessitates numerous swaps and comparisons. Shell sort will sort subarrays that are equal distance apart in the beginning. I have learned that a gap is the term used to describe the distance between two points. We will then continue to close the gap until it reaches 1. With gap=1, it will become an insertion sort, but because of the prior optimization, sorting the array would require far fewer comparisons and element swaps. I have learned that Shell sort used the insertion sort on a widely spread elements, sort them first, then sort the elements with a smaller spacing. Interval is the term for this spacing. This interval is calculated using Knuth's formula, which is as follows:\n",

We'll go over some theory behind selection sorting and how to implement it in Python in this video. I have learned that the unsorted array's smallest element is chosen and swapped with the leftmost element, resulting in that element becoming a part of the sorted array. This process continues to move the unsorted array boundary to the right by one element.Because the average and worst-case complexities of this algorithm are O(n2), where n is the number of items, it is not suitable for large data sets. For example, let us assume that the array [8, 6, 5, 3] needs to be sorted in ascending order. The minimum element in the array 3 is searched for and then swapped with the element that is currently located at the first position, 8. Now the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array is searched for and put in the second position, and so on. I have learn the importance of selection sort and that these algorithms have direct applications in search algorithms, database algorithms, divide-and-conquer methods, data structure algorithms, and a variety of other areas.\n",

      "In Chapter 17 it discusses about Recursion in Python. I have learned the relevance of recursion in the field of computer science, recursion is a crucial concept. A recursion can be used to solve any problem that can be broken down into smaller, simpler problems. I have learned that recursion is the one that calls itself. Meaning Recursion is a problem-solving technique in which you solve smaller parts of the problem until you reach the larger, original problem. If a method or function can call itself, it is recursive. I have learned that I can use recursive functions to write efficient programs with a small amount of code. The disadvantage is that if not written properly, they can result in infinite loops and other unexpected outcomes. The function is terminated in the example above if the number is 0 or less than 9 or greater than 9. If the proper cases aren't included in a recursive function to stop it from running forever, the program will crash or become unresponsive.
